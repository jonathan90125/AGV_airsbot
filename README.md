# Airsbot

This is the repo of airsbot which is an AGV of two versions, which are the **indoor** version and the **outdoor** version. Two robots could be equipped with various devices to perform different tasks. When I was in charge of developing the robots, the indoor robot is equipped with a sprayer to disinfect to protect us from COVID19 during this specific period, and the outdoor version is used in construction site to carry material for workers.

The major difference of two robots is their firmware. They both use in-wheel motors, but the communication rules for each motor are different according to their manufacturer.  Moreover, one needs IMU data while the other needs ultrasonic data. Their LADAR and controlling joystick are also different. In general, the firmware need two types code for STM32 chips while the host need only one version of code based on ROS.

(some details and devices have changed).

#### 0.2. Software Architecture

![](./airsbot_doc/software_architecture.png)

**airsbot_base**: Responsible for communicating with MCU, reading odometry and sensor information and releasing it to the corresponding topic in ROS, receiving twist message from cmd_vel topic and converting it into two speed instructions for wheels and transmitting them to MCU. Moreover, it is responsible for processing and releasing TF transformation from base_link to odom.

**airsbot_sensor**: Configuration and startup files for lTME-02A LiDAR and ASTRA-Mini-028 depth camera. 

**airsbot_description**: Contain URDF files for chassis, camera and radar to achieve TF transformation from base_link to laser_link and camera_link.  

**airsbot_interface**: Responsible for modbus-tcp communication with the scheduling layer to achieve remote control and status monitoring of the AGV. 

 **airsbot_tool**：  Responsible for simulation tests, such as sending cmd_vel instruction, setting navigation_goal, simulating scheduling layer client. 

**airsbot_slam, airsbot_navigation**: Responsible for drawing and navigation of AGV. The basic framework of navigation uses ROS Navigation Stack. The main work is to set move_base parameters, such as base_local_planner_params. yaml, costmap_common_params.yaml, global_costmap_params.yaml, local_costmap_params.yaml configured and provides tf, odom, and sensor information needed to run move_base. Apart from LADAR and depth camera, QR code was also used to supplementary information to navigation algorithms.

Three different open source schemes are used for map building and positioning, including Gmapping, SLAM-Toolbox and Cartographer for map building, and AMCL, SLAM-Toolbox and Cartographer for navigation and positioning. At present, three schemes have been successfully implemented to provide real-time location information according to existing maps in map construction and navigation. Figure below shows me building map using Cartographer.

<div align=center><img src=".\airsbot_doc\3.png" alt="3" width="600" /></div>    

 After that, the three algorithms are run  respectively . Ground truth odometry data is obtained by using the motion capture system, APE results are evaluated by using evo_slam, and the optimal algorithm is selected based on results. According to the result, Cartographer has the best performance. The figure below shows the comparison between ground truth trajectory and the predicted trajectory generated by navigation algorithms (dotted line is the trajectory, left is ground truth, colors shows the value of the APE).

Check git status by

    $ cd {DIR_AIRSBOT}  
    $ git status

Then, the following messages are shown

    On branch xxx

If the current branch is not on **main** branch, checkout **main** branch by the following  

    $ git checkout main

Pull the **updated** main branch

    $ git pull origin main

### 5.2. Create a new branch based on main branch. 

The **naming rule** of a new branch is `${DEVELOPER/NAME_OF_BRANCH},` for example `zhouhongjun/dev`

    $ git branch zhouhongjun/dev

And checkout the branch  

    $ git checkout zhouhongjun/dev

Always modify and push your code **on your branch**.

## Slave Computer

MCU adopts STM32F105VCT6 chip and is mainly responsible for the following contents，all the related code can be found in the folder **airsbot_firmware**: 

<div align=center><img src=".\airsbot_doc\7.jpg" alt="7" width="600" /></div>    

### Indoor

1.  Using CAN to communicate with in-wheel motor to read or set motor's real-time speed and position 
2. Using CAN to communicate with battery to read the remaining power and other information
3. USART communication with IMU chip to read sensor information, and the specific communication content format is determined by IMU chip manufacturer 
4. The ultrasonic module used is HC-SR04. Firstly the GPIO and timer are configured properly. Then, sending a high level signal more than 10us to the TRIG port of the module. When the ECHO signal is received, turn on the timer to start timing. When the echo signal disappears, turn off the timer; The distance is determined by the timer timing time
5. The real-time odometry calculation of differential chassis is completed by using the velocity read from motor 
6. Implement remote control of the PlayStation 4 controller to the AGV
7. USART RS232 communication with host computer, receiving host computer control instructions and sending back odometry and sensor information

### Outdoor

1.  Using CAN to communicate with in-wheel motor to read or set motor's real-time speed and position, motor type is different from indoor version, so the communication format is completely different
2.  Using CAN to communicate with battery to read the remaining power and other information，battery type is different from indoor version, so the communication format is completely different
3.  USART communication with IMU chip to read sensor information, and the specific communication content format is determined by IMU chip manufacturer 
4.  The ultrasonic module used is KS114, this module contains 8 probes, using USART communication to read ranging data
5.  WS2812B LED belt configuration. Since if using the CPU directly in the main loop to achieve PWM wave control for LED belt occupies too much resources, I use DMA+TIM method to generate the PWM wave needed.
6.  The real-time odometry calculation of differential chassis is completed by using the velocity read from motor 
7.  Implement remote control of the a SBUS protocol controller to the AGV
8.  USART RS485 communication with host computer, receiving host computer control instructions and sending back odometry and sensor information
